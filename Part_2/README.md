# Aerospace Software Final Project: Part II

In this part, we parallelized the serial optimized matrix-matrix multiplication from Part I using openMP.

How to Compile/Run: 
------
To run the entire Part II code, which runs the code multiple times using 1, 2 4, and 8:
**> ./RunParallel.sh**

To run and profile the Part II code using 8 threads:
**> ./RunParallel_profile.sh**

If you desire to run a single case, follow the examples in ./RunParallel.sh
